                Waqquas and Benjamin attended the biannual IEEE PowerTech conference, this year in Kiel, Germany. They presented their research on <em>‘Explainable DC Optimal Power Flow Decision’</em>. building on findings from Benjamin's Master's thesis. The work aims to improve the transparency of optimisation tools in electricity markets, particularly regarding economic dispatch decisions, which are becoming increasingly difficult to comprehend due to
 the complexities of modern power system optimisation problems.

                <h4>Paper: A Data-Driven Exploration of Britain’s Balancing Mechanism</h4>
                <p class="about">On average, the National Grid ESO spends £5,947 per minute to balance the electricity
                    system. In the time it takes to read this message, over £2,800 might have been spent to maintain this
                    balance. Our research finds that a significant portion of these costs stems from inadequate network infrastructure.
                    The paper detailing these findings is currently under review, and a preprint
                    is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12787994" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

                <p class="about"> Ultra-high-voltage transmission technologies provide a potential solution to increase  the power transfer capability while minimising transmission losses. The VoltXpanse project aims to investigate economic, efficient, and deliverable UHV transmission solutions, e.g. 765 kV  AC and 800 kV DC, to increase the power transfer capability in the GB transmission system. Our research group is providing the assessment tools required to evaluate the feasibility of deploying  such technologies in the GB system.</p>
